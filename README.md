VREngine is a Unreal Engine plugin that lets you easily create VR projects. It provides all the necessary ground work so you can focus more on the game rather than creating basic VR things like movement and item pickup.

## Motivation

VREngine was developed as a side project for one of my games I made at college. The main idea was to create a plugin containing all the essential tools for me to create more VR games later on without needing to code everything again.

## Main Features

## Example Project

An example project for Unreal Engine can be found [here](https://github.com/Jordonbc/VREngine-template). You should be able to change engine version if you change the plugin files to the appropriate branch.
## Code

Everything in the plugin is written in C++, no blueprints here.

You can use blueprints if you don't like coding in C++ the functions will be listed on the wiki.

## Tech/Frameworks used

Built with:

- Unreal Engine
- OpenXR

## Installation

### Using precompiled dlls

Once you download the zip file extract it and either place the extracted folder in the Plugins folder of your game or in the engine plugin folder for global use.

### Building from Source

If you build VREngine from source you must place this repository in a folder called Plugins in the base directory of your game where the .uproject lives e.g. mygame/Plugins/VREngine

## API Reference

You can use the Wiki to find information about all the functions.

## VREngine Plugins
