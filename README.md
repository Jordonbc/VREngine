# VREngine

VREngine is a Unreal Engine plugin that lets you easilly create VR projects. It provides all the nesseccary ground work so you can focus more on the game rather than creating basic VR things like movement and item pickup.

## Motivation

VREngine was developed as a side project for one of my games I made at college. The main idea was to create a plugin containing all the essential tools for me to create more VR games later on without needing to code everything again.
